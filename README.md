# PHP Type Juggling Bug
This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in PHP related to type juggling when working with arrays and arithmetic operations.  The `bug.php` file contains a function that calculates the average of an array.  However, this function doesn't handle non-numeric values gracefully, leading to warnings and potential calculation errors.
The `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version of the function which safely handles various input types.
This example highlights the importance of strict type checking and robust error handling in PHP to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure the accuracy of your calculations.
